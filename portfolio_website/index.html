              This website aims to educate users about the progress of the coronavirus pandemic. It alerts the user on the safety level of the destination in NSW they are planning to visit.
              This website achieves these goals by presenting data in a visual, minimalistic interface and allow users to make easy, informed decisions about the places they are travelling 
              so they may keep themselves and the ones they love safe. Once a location has been searched, a safety level indicator as well as some general safety tips/suggestions will appear at the bottom. 
              Also displayed are the daily count of cases and total cumulative cases and deaths in NSW. Users can also view graphs of likely sources of infection and affected age ranges. Additional features include 
              personalised twitter feeds, a share button and a day/night toggle to keep users interested.

              <div class="content">
                  <h3>Purpose</h3>
                  <p>
                    To research the concept of a viable topic that could potentially be implemented after forming teams.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Initial Ideas</h3>
                  <p>
                    The first 2 weeks of semester were spent brainstorming ideas in small groups. These 'ice-breakers' were
                    very useful in getting to know what topics others were passionate about and also gave an insight into their
                    design choices, thought processes and overall vision of their project, which was very interesting to see.
                    Our group got to brainstorm several unique, intriguing ideas on Padlet. Some of my ideas included educational outcomes year 12,
                    global volcanic activity, and mental health statistics in young adults.
                  </p>
                  <img class="fade-in" src="images/Design Exploration/ideation.JPG" alt="ideation exercise">
                  <h3>Research Phase</h3>
                  <p>
                    With these ideas in mind, I set out to research each dataset separately. I started with my first idea, endangered marine animals.
                    When I started researching the dataset, I found it to be quite simple but not enough for what I envisioned. Hence, I began to research
                    other datasets so I could correlate these with my primary dataset. I started to look for some inspirational websites, starting with the popular
                    'Awwwards' website which displays some of the most creative website ideas. I stumbled upon an ocean acidification interactive website (link below) which I thought
                    had cool animations and interactivity which would form the backbone of my hypothetical website. I began to get the idea of correlating ocean acidification
                    with my existing dataset, thus showing the trend of periodic ocean acidification decreasing coral health.
                  </p>
                  <a id="inspiration" href="https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/diving-into-an-acidifying-ocean/">Diving Into An Acidifying Ocean Website</a><br><br>
                  <p>
                    After viewing this website, I began to draw a concept sketch of what my website would look like, trying to model it in a simple but interactive way, much like my
                    inspiration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, this research culminated in the Design Exploration Pitch where each person presented their ideas in front of the tutors.
                    By this point, from looking at my concept sketch, I had created my target audience, personas and thoroughly knew the purpose of my website.
                    This was my final poster:
                  </p>
                  <img class="fade-in" src="images/Design Exploration/poster.JPG" alt="poster pitch">
                  <h3>Reflections</h3>
                  <p>
                    The exploration pitch went as expected, and I got to see some other wonderful ideas! I was pretty confident with my idea but the feedback suggested that
                    more research and interactivity would be needed. I was also unsure whether my idea was novel enough to distinguish it from other existing websites. I was also not sure
                    if I would be able to implement all the features that I had planned within the allotted timeframe. Hence, I decided to scrap
                    my idea at the risk of sounding too generic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If I could improve anything, it would be that I should have taken more time to analyse the feedback. Reflecting back now, I realise that it wasn't a bad idea to begin with 
                    and I got swayed by the responses in the pitch. It would certainly feel livelier than CoronaTracker and at the same time, would impart a strong message.
                    If I had gone with my idea, I would be more motivated thus producing a better result.

                <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
                <p>To summarise, these were the main project requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Make an engaging, interactive website</li>
                  <li>Use at least 1 dataset with the primary dataset coming from the data.gov.au repository</li>
                  <li>Enhance the experience of users in a novel, meaningful way</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Forming Teams and Initial Ideas</h3>
                <p>
                  As part of forming a well-coordinated, balanced team, a skillset questionnaire needed to be answered.
                </p>
                <img class="fade-in" src="images/Part A/skills.JPG" alt="skillset questionnaire">
                <p>
                  After forming teams, we collaborated on initial ideas. I collated these ideas into a document.
                </p>
                <img class="fade-in" src="images/Part A/team_ideas.JPG" alt="collective ideas for team 6">
                <p>
                  As I was uncertain whether I would be able to implement my own idea
                  to a high quality within the allotted timeframe, I could eliminate that prospect.
                  As Neha's idea was felt to be too static and 'boring' to audiences, we eliminated her idea as well.
                  This left us with Adit and Conor. Adit was also unsure about whether to implement his idea as the dataset
                  that he had found was not being regularly updated. Hence, the team tentatively decided to research Conor's idea.
                </p>
                <h3>Research & Inspirations</h3>
                <p>I began my research on inspirational websites. Thus, we ended up with 4 main inspirational websites:</p>

                <h3>Forming the Early Design</h3>
                <p>On an online software, Miro, our team created a rough sketch of what our website would eventually become.</p>
                <img class="fade-in" src="images/Part A/early_prototype.JPG" alt="rough concept sketch">
                <p>
                  This included all the features that our team had envisioned earlier through our research. In addition to this, I designed
                  the layout of elements in the website, thus creating the model above.
                </p>
                <h3>My Contributions</h3>
                <p>I contributed significantly in this initial design phase. Some of my roles include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Designing early prototype</li>
                  <li>Background research and feature selection</li>
                  <li>Deciding USF (Unique Selling Factor) of website</li>
                  <li>Collating team ideas</li>
                  <li>Lead team brainstorming to refine ideas.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p>
                  I would consider Part A to be very successful, as our team had not only refined our concept, we had started to implement our website
                  by the end of Week 8. Furthermore, we now had a clear-cut goal we could work towards as
                  opposed to in the beginning when we were still unsure about our individual ideas coming to fruition. We knew that we had made the best choice
                  out of all our ideas by the time of presenting the initial concept. This was helped by the fact that we had done all the research beforehand, so
                  we had a solid base to work off of. Our primary issue was with the team dynamics. Initially, our communication was not very spontaneous as we did not
                  know each other well. This caused problems when it came to writing the report. Although, with my project management skills I managed to equally distribute
                  tasks to each team member, and successfully finish the report, our lack of time management skills was pretty evident.

                    Most of our website's key features had already been implemented as below. The map had been completed with users
                    able to search for any location on the map and getting a valid safety ranking.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The cases-to-death ratio feature was scrapped due to implementation issues. Instead the safety ranking would coincide with
                    the size of the marker on the map.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In addition, to make the map less cluttered, the team decided to only mark the searched location
                    as opposed to displaying all COVID cases at the same time.
                  </li>

                  <li>The design and styling was created according to the refined concept sketch from Part A</li>

                <p>
                  I formulated some criteria that would measure the success of our website. This is illustrated below.

                <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p>
                  I faced several implementation issues while trying to code the website, mainly I had issues with accessing the dataset. This was immediately
                  solved by adding a missing character in the AJAX call. I tried to implement the next feature using the Google Maps API as had been planned.
                  We had originally picked the Google Maps API as it has a plethora of additional features such as 'satellite view' and 'GPS navigation' that would have enhanced the interactivity
                  on our website. However, I found out that using the Google API needed a paid API key. Not wanting to pay extra money, I started looking for other options.
                  We had been learning how to implement Leaflet maps in workshops so I decided to use this instead of Google Maps. The Leaflet map looked great aesthetically, but most importantly
                  it was free. Furthermore, a software which complemented leaflet, ESRI Geocoder, would allow me to implement search functionality. Once I learnt how to access datasets, I could easily
                  implement all the other core features such as safety alert and the daily counter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Coming to the other members of my team, they seemed underconfident in coding the website, despite having the skills to do so. However, they were perhaps just busy in other courses. 
                  The task distribution thus piled onto me as I had to learn most of the coding, primarily using examples covered in the workshops. 
                  To add to this, each team member's work was constantly overwritten by another, leading to features needing to be re-implemented or sometimes forgotten. Hence we needed to establish a 
                  communication protocol where only one person would work on the website at a time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the time came to show our progress, however, we found that we were much ahead of many other teams at the time. We already had an idea of what our final website would look like and
                  we had implemented all our main features. Other teams also seemed to like our simplistic design and novel approach. However, for some, it felt too simple and lacking. We had reasoned that
                  this was because we had not finished our other features yet, such as fact graphs and twitter feeds. Other feedback is illustrated below.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Overall, I would consider Part B a great success, considering that our website was on the right track, as we were ahead of our task distribution plan.
                  We managed to achieve so much with a significant number of technical and personal obstacles in our way. And the feedback at the end was very rewarding as we thought we were doing worse than we actually were.
                  These goals were very much achievable by the time of the tradeshow. I was facing issues initially with my team, but I was beginning to see they were taking much more initiative towards the end of Part B assessment.
                  I still believe that this inequal contribution could be improved by discussing early with the course coordinator.

              <div class="content">
                <h3>Deliverables</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Finished web application</li>
                  <li>Design Report</li>
                  <li>Tradeshow Presentation</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Changes to Concept</h3>
                <p>
                  Responding to feedback from Part B, the group got together and brainstormed some ideas to improve our design and aesthetics.
                  Firstly, we added an information button as the prior feedback suggested that people were not finding the website as intuitive as we
                  wanted it to be since there were no indicators on how to use the website. They remarked that the website was not easy to navigate due to this reason.
                  However, we did not want to stray away from the minimalistic approach, hence we decided to add an information button that could be clicked to reveal the site's
                  purpose and instructions on how to use the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another key change we made was with general aesthetics. As the feedback suggested, we chose a predominantly white colour scheme so as to get rid of the dull atmosphere
                  that the earlier iteration showed with the light gray colour scheme. The colour scheme in the night mode was unchanged. We also decided that the layout of the site should be
                  more linear so that the information was easier to follow. The graphs, originally supposed to be to the right of the map, were moved down for two reasons: the aforementioned reason and
                  because, upon original implementation, it decreased the readability of the map.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to the above changes, we made a few changes of our own. An important change was replacing news articles with Twitter feeds. This would give a more personalised touch and create a more
                  "relatable" atmosphere for the target audience. News articles tend to be negative and instill fear in a user. As we want to politely inform the user rather than scare them away, Twitter feeds would be
                  the best choice since they display a more positive side to the pandemic, retaining more users in the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Minor changes include refining the safety ranking range and making the website more responsive. We decided to be more specific with the safety ranking as it is not a black and white concept.
                  An area can contain few cases and so it is neither safe nor unsafe. Hence, we expanded the range to include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Safe: 0 - 9 cases</li>
                    <li>Low Chance: 10 - 29 cases</li>
                    <li>Mildly Unsafe: 30 - 59 cases</li>
                    <li>Unsafe: 60 - 99 cases</li>
                    <li>Very Unsafe - 100+ cases</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, although we were originally planning to make a desktop-based site, as the most common users would be between the ages of 30 and 40, we decided to make the website more responsive. This is because our target audience
                  also included younger people, who would most likely use this site on a phone or tablet.

                <h3>Tradeshow</h3>
                <p>
                  During the tradeshow, we invited as many users as we could to try our completed website. Because there were so many people attending the tradeshow,
                  we were getting only a couple of visitors at a time. However, most people who tried our website loved it due to its simplicity and well thought out concept.
                  Our demonstration of the website included a powerpoint presentation of our concept, and a brief live demonstration of the website, which I carried out.

                </ul>
                <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p>
                  In retrospect, rather than demonstrating ourselves, I think we should have allowed the users to play with the website themselves; this would have increased the appeal of our website more and attracted
                  more users. Since it was our first time having a virtual tradeshow, the team had no idea how to make our website accessible to other users. Also because we couldn't see how users were.
                  It was definitely a new experience for all of us compared to previous years. I think we could have gained some valuable information
                  about user experience if we allowed users to navigate through our website rather than demonstrating. However, given the tradeshow was online, it was difficult to see exactly what users were experiencing in
                  the first place. Having a virtual tradeshow has its disadvantages but, overall, it was a very fun time for all teams involved! The most fascinating part is it's a great way to view other peoples' work as well!

                  From the feedback we got, I think that our success criteria for simplicity, engagement and informativity were achieved. We did not get to see how easy our website was to navigate for other users but
                  I think this area could be certainly improved. Looking back, most users probably would not look at the website info button, so the website needs to contain more navigational tools. This could be something like popup menus whenever
                  a user is about to hover over an element to perform an action.

                  Users were also looking for a slightly more aesthetic look than what we had in our final website. For example, people gave feedback about using a colour such as blue instead of the white background we had. 
                  So we could have forgone a few additional features such as the 3D/2D map toggle to achieve a more aesthetic design.
                  All throughout the lifespan of the project, we had been focusing on functionality, thinking that aesthetics could be easily fixed later. But now I see that aesthetics should have been given equal priority to programming as this can
                  determine how much users "like" to use the website.

          <h1>Course Reflections</h1>
          <article class="text">
            <div class="fade-in">
              <h3>Expectations</h3>
              <p>
                I had expected this course to be similar to DECO1400, which I thoroughly enjoyed last semester.
                Initially, I couldn't clearly visualize what this course was about or what team I would end up with
                as there weren't any previous reviews on the course. However, I did expect the course to be easy and fun
                given that you had skilled, supportive team members.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the semester went on, I found myself with a team that was perhaps not as motivated as they should have been.
                This may be due to the idea that we picked, as we all had vastly differing ideas and we equated more interactivity
                with a higher uniqueness factor. I believe, looking back, that we should have picked a topic that we were truly passionate
                about, no matter if it did not have the interactivity we wanted. We would have worked out the unique features as time went on.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it comes to team dynamics, I believe I did my best as the leader of Team 6. Initially, I was facing some difficulty as the team
                communication was shaky and no one had a clear idea of what their roles were. This meant that most of the roles shifted onto me, and so, although
                I envisioned myself to be a designer on the team, I ended up doing the main development and basic UI design. However, in the final stages after Part B, I realised I was the one who was pushing myself too hard,
                and decided to rest for the time being. I saw that the rest of my team was more than happy to pull together to create the final design. At this point, 
                we really started to understand each other more, thus evening out the workflow. Seeing the near-finished product, and seeing as how I did all the important work up till that point, 
                I assume my team finally got motivated to finish the website.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="fade-in">
              <h3>Learning Experiences</h3>
              <p>I had set out some learning expectations in my first journal post:</p>
              <q>
                I hope to advance my coding knowledge in [PHP] further. 
                I also hope to learn about how to use APIs to facilitate front-back end communication.
              </q>
              <p>
                I got to learn PHP in the workshops, and while it was recommended for a faster performance in the website,
                because we decided to implement a topic which was heavy on interaction, and because it was more convenient to
                just use Javascript (there were way more examples on AJAX calls), we went with using Javascript AJAX. So I didn't get to actually implement PHP on my own website.
                However, in the end, I did get to learn the dynamics of back end systems, through the workshops and through implementing my own site.
                In my learning, I also discovered great API libraries and frameworks that I can now use for future projects (Leaflet.js, ESRI). In the end, these ended up being some of our core features.
                I had also wanted to improve my design skills, but unfortunately didn't get much opportunity to do so as I started to become more of a developer. I became very functionality-centred with the site,
                although I helped make a few design decisions in Part A.
              </p>
              <q>
                I would like to create a solid team that I can hopefully befriend to develop a strong network of likeminded people who can help each other in times of need.
              </q>
              <p>
                When it came to group work, I realised an important tenet of working in a team, that is healthy communicaation. I was trying extra hard to be the team leader and to get everything done despite the enormous
                pressures on me. As I saw after Part B, my team had the skill all along to complete the website, and I realised that I was stressing myself more than required. It was something to do with my leadership of the team.
                Despite the problems that can arise with teamwork, I wouldn't do this project alone. I really got close to my team members, and
                they helped me out a lot during the semester. Without their help, I would not have been able to get the site from Part B to final product standard. My team members
                also seemed to be more design-oriented just like me and brought their novel ideas that would really shape the final aesthetics of the site. I only wish that my teammates were more proactive in their learning
                rather than just listening to what I had to say.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regarding course activities, I found the contacts to be very engaging and supportive. We could always rely on a tutor's help whenever we were stuck on implementation.
                The first contact was especially important as it not only got our creative juices flowing right away, we could gauge what kind of people would be best suited as team members.
                However, I do believe that preparing for the important contact assessments, such as concept pitches and writing reports, took away from our time actually designing and implementing
                our main website. I feel like the course could have done with less of the reports and only 1 pitch. It is a bit disappointing when your team has vastly differing ideas, as was my case,
                and so you have to forgo your initial exploration concept for a topic that the entire team would find easy to implement. I learnt that the topic you chose greatly affected motivation throughout
                the semester and, hence, the result of your work. I feel that I could have taken more time trying to think of ways to combine our ideas rather than just going with one idea that may not be liked by
                all team members. For example, one of our team members had an idea for real estate and another for historic pictures of QLD. Maybe, we could have combined these 2 ideas and done a website that was
                about historic real estate, which would have been perhaps more engaging than a topic such as tracking coronavirus cases, which is naturally gloomy-sounding.

                  I would love to expand my skillset more by learning new technologies
                  online if given the choice. Practicing on my own would help me to create a better product in the future.
                  I would also like to learn to be a better designer as I did not get much hands-on practice with design
                  tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

                  I would like to be more communicative when my team is not acting appropriately.
                  I feel like we could do a better job if the team performs consistently, and some ground rules
                  need to established early on in order to achieve this.

                <p>
                  I felt like the workshops were very basic and could not teach me more
                  than I wanted to know. In addition, the reports took up valuable time from developing the
                  main website. Hence, it would be better if time was better utilized in self-learning and
                  creating a website with almost no help as this would promote better learning.

              <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>
              This portfolio was my first opportunity to showcase some of my creativity in making a quality website that tells a good story of my journey through this course.
              With simplicity in mind, I started by drawing a simple wireframe for the layout of the page and some of the navigation options. I also considered responsiveness of the webpage. 
            </p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/wireframe.jpg" alt="wireframe of portfolio">
            <p>
              I began with the most important part of a portfolio, its basic layout. I created a simple but mobile-friendly HTML skeleton, keeping progressive enhancement in mind, and added content along the way
              so I could see what I was styling. Then I started thinking of colour schemes to implement in CSS, choosing warm, but pure, solid colours to keep the site simple. I also constantly tested the responsiveness of the website
              on my phone, as well as in the element inspector of different browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
              I chose two main plugins: an image carousel plugin and an 'animate-on-scroll' plugin to increase useability, and to enhance the experience of the user by further minimizing website content and . I chose the plugins because they made the website feel more alive
              and not plain and static. I also chose them as they had the best browser support and responsiveness. I first started designing the site header, which initially contained the 'About Me' section. However, since I wanted to go for a minimalistic design, I chose to have
              a large header with simple text and an arrow to scroll down. I chose a solid ebony colour to give good contrast and to further simplify the design.
            </p>
            <img src="images/portfolio/final_header_design.JPG" alt="final design for the header of the website">
            <p>
              I then designed and styled the dividers between each section for easily distinguishing different sections. 
              The top navigation menu links to each section, and there is a 'Back To Top' link at the bottom of the website to quickly scroll back up.
            </p>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              This portfolio documents the design process used to create CoronaTracker and describe my contributions to the project. 
              It was created as a single webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, designed entirely by myself. I hope this portfolio 
              successfully outlines my contribution and design process throughout the entire course. The portfolio is meant to be simple but journal-like, and I hope
              this site reflects these design choices. The content is a summary of my private journal entries and journal posts
              where I have documented project progress and individual contributions and reflections.
