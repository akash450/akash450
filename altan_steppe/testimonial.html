                            Me and a couple of my friends were staying at Altan Steppe in the winter for our all-Australia gap year tour. 
                            Firstly, the view in the Altan Steppe resort itself was more breathtaking than we could imagine! Surrounded by crystal, white alps,
                            it was like stepping into a time machine to a simpler past where all you needed to live a happy life was quality food, shelter and a
                            stress-free but intensely laborious day spent with good friends. Of particular note was that each and every activity showcased the passion
                            the staff members had, and we always got to learn both valuable life lessons as well as intriguing facts about ancient Mongolia. 
                            The menu had a great variety of traditional food choices and the meals succulently sublime!
                            The staff there were very attentive, professional and friendly. There are a myriad of activities both in the resort and outside 
                            so you'll never be bored. Would recommend to go at least once in your lifetime while you still can!

                            I planned a visit to the Snowy Mountains region on a solo trip and was recommended the well-known historic resort Altan Steppe.
                            I was newly diagnosed with ALS so I was a bit skeptical whether this supposedly rugged and harsh 'resort' would accomodate me well.
                            I stand corrected, because it was the most fun I've had in many years. The atmosphere feels very simplistic and like being around
                            the campfire at night on a summer camp. Sure it was pretty harsh but it caters greatly to people like me with disability-friendly versions 
                            of their activities. There are also disability ramps at every entrance. And don't get me started on their juicy, fatty dishes at their 'Zurkh Be Suns'
                            restaurant. The only complaint I had was the absolute emptiness of the area and the lack of technology at hand. I was disconnected entirely from 
                            the outside world, but I guess that's what they were going for right?

                            Me and my cousins went on a family trip to Altan Steppe in the summer of November 2018. We had planned the trip for 4 days. As soon as we stepped 
                            into the resort, we were washed over with a feeling of homesickness as, although they call themselves a 'resort', they were really trying 
                            to emulate the harsh environments that the Mongol nomads encountered. As a result the place looked very empty and desolate with vast 
                            stretches of grassland and rocks below a set of snow-capped mountains. However, the warm, hospitable service we received was enough to get
                            rid of our homesickness by the next day. The atmosphere was a refreshing change as I come from the Sydney CBD. Activities were thoroughly
                            enjoyable once you learnt how to do some of them (we had never done horseback archery before!). All the food dishes, however, were meat-based.
                            There were 2 vegetarian options, but all they had were fried or steamed variants of meat and milk accompaniments to go with it. It started to get
                            a bit bland and boring after a while eating the same thing. Overall great experience and I would recommend it to all who love some good food, atmosphere, 
                            beautiful nature and just a 'summer-camp-like' adventure.
